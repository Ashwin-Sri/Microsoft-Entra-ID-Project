## üîê Credential Handling

This script uses a `param` block to accept credentials as input.  
For security reasons, no secrets are hardcoded or stored in the repo.  
If you're testing locally, provide your `TenantId`, `ClientId`, and `ClientSecret` manually when running the script.

This repo is for showcasing automation logic ‚Äî not for sharing production-ready secrets or modules.
