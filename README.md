This project demonstrates my validated experience with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), reflecting the depth and editorial rigor identity administrator role. Tasks are executed in a live tenant using both the Entra Admin Center and PowerShell, with screenshots, annotations, and outcome validation.

The project is divided into two distinct tracks:

- **GUI Tasks** – Manual administration using the Entra portal  
- **PowerShell Tasks** – Scripted automation for scalable identity workflows

## Scope

All tasks are scoped to reflect real-world identity lifecycle, access control, and license management scenarios. GUI tasks focus on role-authentic workflows within the Entra Admin Center. PowerShell tasks are modular, securely structured, and documented with execution notes and troubleshooting guidance.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate hands-on experience with Microsoft Entra ID administration  
- Showcase automation capabilities using secure PowerShell scripting  
- Reflect editorial precision in portal validation, role boundaries, and licensing awareness

## Skills Demonstrated

- **User & Group Management** – Manual creation, dynamic groups, membership control  
- **License Assignment** – Individual and group-based licensing workflows  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Role assignment and validation  
- **Administrative Unit Delegation** – Scoped admin control for organizational boundaries  
- **Conditional Access Policies** – GUI-based policy setup (not executed due to licensing scope)  
- **PowerShell Automation** – Modular scripts with secure credential handling and `.gitignore` hygiene

## Real-World Use Cases

- Automating license assignment for onboarding workflows  
- Delegating scoped admin roles using administrative units  
- Managing dynamic security groups for access control  
- Validating role permissions and troubleshooting assignment issues  
- Executing identity tasks at scale using PowerShell with Microsoft Graph modules

## Editorial Notes

- All portal paths, role requirements, and licensing boundaries are validated against live tenant experience  
- GUI and PowerShell tasks are separated to preserve clarity and role authenticity  
- Conditional Access policies are executed in the Entra Admin Center GUI. PowerShell-based automation and reporting for CA and compliance tasks are marked as adjacent and deferred due to licensing scope.
