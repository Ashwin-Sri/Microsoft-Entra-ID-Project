# Task 14 â€“ Microsoft Entra ID: Access Reviews

## Definition

Access Reviews in Microsoft Entra ID allow administrators to periodically evaluate whether users should retain access to specific resourcesâ€”such as group memberships, role eligibility, or application assignments. Reviews can be scheduled or one-time, and decisions can be made by admins, group owners, or users themselves. This supports least privilege enforcement and compliance-driven access governance.

---

## Objective

This task demonstrates how to configure and run Access Reviews to validate user access to Microsoft 365 groups. The goal is to reduce stale permissions, enforce governance, and automate access cleanup.

---

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Entra ID P2 license assigned to reviewer and target users
- Admin access to Microsoft Entra admin center
- At least one Microsoft 365 group with members assigned

---

## Features Implemented

- One-time access review for group membership
- Reviewer assignment (self-review or admin)
- Decision helper (last sign-in visibility)
- Post-review action: remove access if not reviewed

---

## Navigation Path

1. Go to [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com)

### 4. Apply Results

  - After review period ends:

   In this validation, I acted as both the group owner and assigned reviewer, completing the review via My Access.
