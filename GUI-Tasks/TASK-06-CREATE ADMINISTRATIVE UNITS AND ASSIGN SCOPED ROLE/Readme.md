## Note

- Administrative Units (AUs) allow **delegated administration** to specific groups or departments.
- Scoped roles only apply within the AU, not tenant-wide.
- Keep "**Restricted management administrative unit**" set to No, unless you're specifically managing privileged roles like Global Admins.
